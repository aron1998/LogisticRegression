# LogisticRegression
This model is a binary classifier designed without using ML libraries from scratch.
I designed this model to predict the possibility of admitting a student based on two exam scores.

It includes two features-Exam score 1 and Exam score 2,
Label 0 - Not admitted,
Label 1 - Admitted

Also, I have added another .py file at the end for the same classification problem using sklearn
